# Honey_Consumption_Python_Project
Data Analysis Project with Python - NYCDSA

## Introduction:
My name is Margaret and I am studying Data Science with Machine Learning at New York City Data Science Academy. This is my first project working with data sets, Python, and GitHub.


## Data:
I used two data sets from Kaggle.

US Honey Production 1995-2021:

Honey Production in the USA (1998-2012):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/honey-production/data


## Project:
These data sets were a great opportunity for me to learn how to work with dataframes using Python and how to visualize the data.

While the 1995-2021 Kaggle set proved unusable, I learned a lot about extracting and verifying data. 

The 1998-2012 data set addressed all the problems encountered in the initial dataframe.
